# ParadiseSPRX
This is the visual studio project for Paradise SPRX

Paradise SPRX for GTA V on the PS3 was started by me in the fall of 2015, originally under the project name of 'Limbo.' It was first released as paradise on May 12, 2016. Progress was very rampant in 2016, 2017, and 2018 until april 2019 when I shut down the services for many months. The project was re-released in early 2020 with not many features added over the course of 2020 and 2021, officially shutting down with GTA Online, December 16, 2021.

I learned so much from the experience and knowledge and friends I gained developing paradise, I want to thank everyone involved along the way.
